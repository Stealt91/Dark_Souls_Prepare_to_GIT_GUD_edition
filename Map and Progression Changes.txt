Upgrade progression:
get +10 embers or equivalent early
	(+10 normal after gargoyles?)
	gate off upgrades via loot:
		magical upgrades with gems(ascencion)+normal materials
		few large shards before sens fortress
		no possibility to farm shards before sens
	get +15 embers after anor londo/lordvessel
		exception: +15 normal after sens (find seal there somewhere?)
		killing sif unlocks lower new londo ruins (only way to fight ghosts now)
		chunks can be farmed in lower new londo ruins

Move drakes to crystal cave (and area in front of that) have drakes in valey of the drakes be non-respawning
Demon titanite farmable in lost izalith (prowling demons (add some more))
Twinkling titanite farmable before nito (kill mask guys)
chunks found in all lategame areas, but can be farmed in lower new londo ruins

farmable:
blue gems: archives
red gems: izalith
white gems: catacombs 
pale gems (for up to +10 equivalent magic weapons): ghosts in new londo ruins, but enough are found before that
upgrade path for casting tools: 3x upgrade with pale gem and 2x upgrade with advanced gem?
	-scaling: material increases scaling by x3 at +5
		-100 base scaling (200 at +0 base, 400 at +5 base) and additional scaling dependent on casting tool

massively reduce armour upgrade costs/investment, no slabs required
