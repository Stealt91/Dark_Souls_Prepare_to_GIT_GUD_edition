Scaling (in weapons param: Correct strength/agility) (aproximate values used/given)
STR scaling has been lowered to 90% of the dex scaling to account for 2hand bonus when using high stat investment (40str)
	-treat str and dex scalings equaly when assigning scaling values, no need to give lower str value to account for 2h dmg

pure dex / pure str weapons:
-primary scaling: 70 (low, B) 80 (average, A) 90(high, S) (SLIGHTLY adjust base damage (+-5% when compared to simillar weapons, more if significant weight difference) when using particularly high/low scalings)
-secondary scaling <30 (D scaling)
-pick particularly low secondary scaling when using high primary scaling

quality build:
-primary and secondary scalings >40
-base damage used comparable to pure dex/str weapons in class!
individual scalings: 50(low, med-low C), 60(average, high C), 70 (high, B) (avoid picking both values as either high or low, adjust base damage SLIGHTLY to account for scalings)




CAUTION: ADAPT MAGICAL BASE DAMAGE DEPENDING ON PHYSICAL BASE DAMAGE for all SCALING magical builds (this does NOT include lightning and enchanted (formerly crystal))!
- around 80 base damage (around 400 physical ar (with 1 attribute scaling at 40) fast weapon): use 100% of normal path physical base damage as physical and magical base damage
- around 120 base damage (around 600 physical ar (with 1 attribute scaling at 40) heavy weapon): use 90% of normal path physical base damage as physical and magical base damage
for everything in-between use linear scaling (around 100 base damage would be a 95% adjustment)



TODO: adjust block values for all weapons
0: normal weapon, stays mostly the same;
100: former crystal weapon (changed into enchanted): sell price the same as normal, magic base damage the same as normal base damage, uncheck disable repair, 10x durability (current/max)
200: former lightning (changed into flaming): set physical scaling equal to normal path, set faith correct to 0, uncheck isCustom, set SpecialAttributes to 2, set lightning damage to 0 and set fire damage to base damage
300: former raw (changed into lightning): set base damages, add scalings, change upgrade path(add 5 to weapon origin), set SpecialAttributes to 6
400: magic weapon: set physical scaling and base damage equal to normal path, set magic correct to 100, set physical and magical base damage as described above, correct type 0
500: former enchanted (changed into crystal): set physical scaling and base damage equal to normal path, set magic correct to 100, set physical and magical base damage as described above, correct type 0
600: divine: set physical scaling and base damage equal to normal path, set faith correct to 100, set physical and LIGHTNING base damage as described above (magical damage set to 0), correct type 0, set SpecialAttributes to 6
700: occult: set physical scaling and base damage equal to normal path, set faith correct to 100, set physical and magic base damage as described above, correct type 0
800: fire: set physical scaling to values of normal, set magic and faith correct to 100, set physical and magical base damage as described above
900: chaos: set physical scaling to values of normal, set magic and faith correct to 100, set physical and magical base damage as described above
